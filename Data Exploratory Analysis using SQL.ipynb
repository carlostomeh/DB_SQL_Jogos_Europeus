    "The relational database we're gonna use in this notebook was created by this means: RDS from AWS, which is a relational database service based on the cloud, being easily configured, scalable, redimensionable, and offering a lot more facilities to implementing and managing a relational database with security and high performance (you can see more about Amazon RDS on https://aws.amazon.com/pt/rds/). Let's explain more about the tools we are using in this project: \n",

    "We've create a relational database in RDS, one of the product on the pool of tools availables in AWS Cloud. We've choosen **MySQL** managed database system because these are one of the most used systems in the relational database context. This database is hosted in \"us-east-1\" zone and is available to connections within the credentials:\n",
